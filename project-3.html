    <p><h3>Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited (/dəˈlɔɪt ˈtuːʃ toʊˈmɑːtsuː/), commonly referred to as Deloitte, is a British multinational professional services network. Deloitte is the largest professional services network by revenue and number of employees in the world and is considered one of the Big Four accounting firms, along with EY, KPMG, and PwC.[5][6]

        The firm was founded by William Welch Deloitte in London, England in 1845 and expanded into the United States in 1890.[7] It merged with Haskins & Sells to form Deloitte Haskins & Sells in 1972 and with Touche Ross in the US to form Deloitte & Touche in 1989. In 1993, the international firm was renamed Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, later abbreviated to Deloitte.[7] In 2002, Arthur Andersen's practice in the UK as well as several of that firm's practices in Europe and North and South America agreed to merge with Deloitte.[8] Subsequent acquisitions have included Monitor Group, a large strategy consulting business, in January 2013.[9] The international firm is a UK private company, limited by guarantee, supported by a network of independent legal entities.[10]
